# Coinex-trading-bot
A bot built with python3 that monitors crypto markets & and automatically trades [DOGE & USDT](https://www.coinex.com/exchange/DOGE-USDT) using the [Python Coinex API](https://pypi.org/project/coinex.py/). The bot publishes it's trading stats to Discord via [Discord Webhooks](https://pypi.org/project/discord-webhook/). 

Please review the code before running it, as it might be wrong or outdated. I never used it much because my CoinEx account only had ~$12 worth of crypto for it to trade with, and the bot couldn't get much traction. Maybe it would work better if it had around $100 to trade with.

#### 2023 Update:
CoinEx recently announced [Spot Grid](https://announcement.coinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/13939012802708), which does the same thing as this script, but probably better. Consider using that instead.
